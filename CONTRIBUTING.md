Make your changes, commit them with descriptive messages, and push the branch to your fork:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

### 5. Using the Makefile

The project includes a `Makefile` to simplify common development tasks. To set up the environment, install dependencies, run tests, and perform linting in one step, you can use:

```bash
make all
```
